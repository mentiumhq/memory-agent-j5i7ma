## Security Architecture

### Authentication

- Primary: JWT tokens (RFC 7519)
  - RSA 2048-bit signatures
  - 90-day rotation policy
  - Strict validation of claims

- Service-to-Service: mTLS
  - TLS 1.3
  - EV SSL certificates
  - Automatic certificate rotation

### Authorization Matrix

| Role | Permissions | Rate Limits |
|------|------------|-------------|
| agent | store, retrieve, search | 100 req/min, 10 concurrent |
| executor | store, retrieve, search, admin | 200 req/min, 20 concurrent |
| admin | store, retrieve, search, admin, security_config | 300 req/min, 30 concurrent |
| system | store, retrieve, search, admin, security_config | 500 req/min, 50 concurrent |

## Security Controls

### Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access review
- Automated deprovisioning

### Rate Limiting
```json
{
  "default_limit": "100/minute",
  "burst_limit": "150/minute",
  "timeout": "300 seconds",
  "tracking": "IP + Token"
}
```

### Input Validation
- Strict schema validation
- Input sanitization
- Content type verification
- Size limits enforcement

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards

| Type | Standard | Implementation |
|------|----------|----------------|
| At Rest | AES-256-GCM | AWS KMS managed keys |
| In Transit | TLS 1.3 | Forward secrecy enabled |
| Backup | AES-256-CBC | Offline key storage |

### Cipher Suites
- TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

### Key Management
- AWS KMS for key management
- Automatic key rotation (365 days)
- Multi-region key backup
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) backed

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
- All authentication attempts
- Authorization decisions
- Data access events
- Configuration changes
- Security alerts

### Security Metrics
```json
{
  "authentication_failure_threshold": "5/minute",
  "brute_force_detection": "10/hour",
  "suspicious_activity_threshold": "50/hour",
  "alert_escalation_time": "15 minutes"
}
```
